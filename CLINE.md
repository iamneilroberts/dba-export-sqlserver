## 2024-02-08 (10)
- Working on fixing orphaned records validation errors:
  - Issue: OrderItems showing orphaned records because parent Orders are outside date range
  - Root cause: Parent table records not being properly exported when referenced by transaction records
  - Solution in progress:
    1. Created sp_ParentTableTypes.sql to define table types for parent table processing
    2. Creating sp_ParentTableProcessing.sql to handle parent table exports:
       - Will identify all parent tables of transaction tables
       - Will export parent records that are referenced by transaction records within date range
       - Will maintain proper relationship integrity
    3. Will modify sp_ExportData to use new parent table processing:
       - Process parent tables first
       - Then process transaction tables
       - Finally process related tables
  - Next steps:
    1. Complete sp_ParentTableProcessing implementation
    2. Update sp_ExportData to use new parent table processing
    3. Update validation to properly check parent-child relationships
    4. Add new test cases to verify parent table handling

## 2024-02-08 (11)
- Implementation progress on parent table processing:
  - Created table type dba.ParentTableType to handle parent-child relationships:
    - Stores schema and table names for both parent and child
    - Tracks column names used in relationships
    - Includes date column information for transaction tables
  - Challenges encountered:
    1. Need to handle multiple child relationships for same parent table
    2. Must ensure proper date range filtering on transaction tables
    3. Complex dynamic SQL needed for flexible relationship handling
  - Current approach:
    1. Split implementation into separate type definition and processing files
    2. Using table variables to store relationship information
    3. Building dynamic SQL with proper error handling
    4. Adding detailed logging and debug output
  - Next immediate steps:
    1. Complete sp_ParentTableProcessing.sql implementation
    2. Add error handling for missing primary keys
    3. Implement proper cleanup of existing export tables
    4. Add performance logging for parent table processing
